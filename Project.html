             <h3>Are low-cost carriers (LCCs) taking over the European airline market?</h3> 
             <descr>In the late 1970s, the domestic airline market in the US liberalised following deregulation in international bilateral agreements, resulting in a rise of low-cost carriers (LCC) and intensified competition. A similar market liberalization spread to Europe with three new sets of deregulating policies, all of which took full effect in 1997 allowing airlines to compete more freely (Anderson, Gang Gong and Lakshmanan, 2005; Cento, 2009). The aim is to examine LCCs role in the European airline market by analyzing various trends across the largest carriers and airline groups, inlcuding full-service carriers (FSC).</descr>
             
 
             <h3> European Passenger growth</h3> 

             <table>
                <tr>
                  <td><div class="chart" id="Chart7"></div></td>
                  <td><div class="chart" id="Chart2000"></div></td> 
                </tr>
              </table> 

            <descr><br>The data for these charts were scraped from Wikipedia, using Python. The charts indicate a growing demand for low-cost carriers, with Ryanair taking the lead in passenger count in 2019 surpassing the airline giant Lufthansa Group. Notably, Ryanair has maintained a considerably greater margin throughout the pandemic, even though the passenger numbers somewhat evened out across carriers during 2020 and 2021.</descr>
            <descr><br><br>Initially, the data in the bar chart was incorrectly sorted for airlines whose data was missing for at least one year. While missing observations coded as "NaN" were interpreted as 0, missing observations coded as "-" somehow broke the sorting in Vega Lite. I thus recoded all "-" as "NaN" and then recoded all "NaN" as "0". This fixed the sorting issue in Vega Lite. However, the sorting went wrong once the graph was saved as a json-file, despite using the new dataset. By looking at each individual code, I finally realised that the sorting also depends on the color encoding command. In my Python notebook I then added a "Category" variable to refer to this in the color encoding, which solved the sorting issue.  </descr>

            <h3>Post-Covid fleet size (2021)</h3>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart200"></div>
            <descr><br>This chart shows Europe's 13 largest airlines by fleet size in 2021. Easyjet is in the lead, followed by Turkish Airlines and Ryanair. 
                <br><br>The data was scraped from InformationDesign (2021), using Python. The scraper identified five tables, which I appended into a single dataframe. Five airlines ended up sharing the same index number so I added the command "ignore_index=True" that prevents the stacking of index numbers but rather gives the appended datasets unique index numbers. </descr>

            <h3>Airline Bailouts and Passenger Count</h3>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart22"></div>
            <descr><br>This scatter graph plots the number of passengers carried by airline or airline group in 2019, and the COVID-19 bailouts issued as of April 2021. The chart suggests that LCCs, displayed as blue circles in the chart, generally receive less state aid than their non-LCC competitors despite often serving a greater number of passengers.</descr>

            <descr><br><br>The passenger data was scraped from Wikipedia using Python while the bailout data was available as a downloadable spreadsheet on Statista. Using the spreadsheet, I divided the airline groups whose bailout data was separated into multiple airlines in the scraped dataset to obtain more matching observations.</descr>

            <h3>Number of passengers carried in Europe (1996-2020)</h3>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart2400"></div>
            <descr><br>This map chart shows the growing demand of air transport geographically. The only challenge here was finding data sources which had data for as many European countries and for as many years as possible. Eurostat provides similar data, but define passenger count differently and completely or almost completely lack data for seven of European countries.</descr>
            <descr><br><br>The dataset was available on the World Bank Data website as a csv-file. I first used Excel to separate the European countries from the non-European countries and then moved the dataset to Python (Google Colab) to do the main data cleaning.</descr>
            <descr><descr class="rubric-launch"><br><br>Link to Colab code, <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uJnqWYd34b019ZbURyPTVdGVE7yDUTWY?usp=sharing"> here</a>.</descr></descr>

        

            <h3>Clustering by Airline stock prices (2017-2022)</h3>
        <div class="frame">
            <pi><img src="project_clustering_stocks.png" alt="Cluster_pic" width="400" height="350"></pi>
        </div>
            
            <descr>Using unsupervised machine learning, the dendrogram displays clusters of stock prices for Wizzair, Ryanair, TUI, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, EasyJet and AirFrance-KLM. I used Python to retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance to then cluster the data into groups. For this, I used loops before standardizing the data into comparable trends. I then applied the Dynamic Time Warping technique, which accounts for temporal lags to better capture similarities in trends.</descr>

            <descr><br><br>The two LCCs, Wizzair and Ryanair, are the most distinguishable set of airlines, as seen in the upper purple branch. All the other carriers are grouped into the lower purple branch, with somewhat inconsistent clusters.</descr>
            <descr><descr class="rubric-launch"><br><br>Link to Colab code, <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sBqlAFsNlLzLeA9QBEg0am_0uH5mzv0n?usp=sharing"> here</a>.</descr></descr>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <descr>In brief, it appears that LCCs are rising in popularity and have played a meaningful role in maintaining connectivity in Europe. Despite the adverse consequences of the pandemic, coupled with greater state aid for non-LCCs, the healthy passenger numbers and fleet size of LCCs indicate that LCCs remain competitive.<br><br>Future researchers may wish to obtain data on ticket fares from a range of airlines to compare price ranges and volatility over time to further analyse the main strategy LCCs compete on: prices. One may also investigate the share of short-haul and long-haul journeys offered by airlines over time to determine whether full-service carriers instead are focusing more on longer routes as LCCs continue to grow within the short-haul market.
