             <h3>Are low-cost carriers (LCCs) taking over the European airline market? [99]</h3> 
             <descr>In the late 1970s, the domestic airline market in the US liberalised following deregulation in international bilateral agreements, resulting in intensified competition through the rise of low-cost carriers (LCC), an overall decline in ticket prices and rising number of passengers. A similar market liberalization spread to Europe with three new sets of deregulating policies, all of which took full effect in 1997 allowing airlines to compete more freely. The aim is to examine the changing European airline market by analyzing various market trends across the largest carriers and airline groups based in Europe, including the fluctuating demand for these.</descr>
             
 
             <h3> European Passenger growth [KLAR, 210]</h3> 

             <table>
                <tr>
                  <td><div class="chart" id="Chart7"></div></td>
                  <td><div class="chart" id="Chart2000"></div></td> 
                </tr>
              </table> 

            <descr><br>The data for these charts were scraped on Wikipedia, using Python. Both charts reveal a growing demand for low-cost carriers, with Ryainair taking the lead in passenger count in 2019 surpassing the airline giant Lufthansa Group. Notably, Ryanair has maintained a considerably greater margin throughout the pandemic, even though the passenger numbers somewhat evened out across carriers during 2020 and 2021.</descr>
            <descr><br><br>Initially, the data in the bar chart was incorrectly sorted for airlines whose data was missing for at least one year. While missing observations coded as "NaN" were appropriately interpreted as 0, missing observations coded as "-" were somehow misread when sorted in Vega Lite. To correct for this, I recoded all "-" as "NaN" and then coded all "NaN" as "0". This fixed the sorting issue in Vega Lite. However, once the graph was saved as a json-file in VC Studio, the sorting was wrong when displayed on the website, despite using the new dataset. By looking at each individual code and by deleting the color commands, I finally realised that the sorting also depends on the color encoding command. I revisited my Python notebook once again and added a "Category" variable to refer to this in the color encoding, which solved the sorting issue. </descr>

            <h3>Fleet size</h3>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart200"></div>
            <descr><br>This chart shows Europe's 13 largest airlines by fleet size. 
                <br><br>The data was scraped from InformationDesign, using Python. The scraper identified five separate tables in the page, all of which containing the desired information. I therefore appended all five lists into a single dataframe. The issue was that the final dataframe did not have unique index numbers for each row of data. Since we drop observations by referring to their index number, it becomes problematic if five different airlines share the same index number. I found an additional command "ignore_index=True" which prevents the stacking of index numbers but rather gives the appended datasets unique index numbers. This is what we need to drop the non-European airlines included in the datasets.</descr>

            <h3>Airline Bailouts and Passenger Count [KLAR]</h3>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart22"></div>
            <descr><br>This scatter graph plots the number of passengers carried by airline or airline group in 2019, before COVID-19 and the bailouts issued, as of April 2021, in response to the pandemic. The chart suggests that LCCs, displayed as blue circles in the chart, generally receive less state aid than their non-LCC competitors, displayed as orange squares.</descr>

            <descr><br><br>The passenger data was scraped from Wikipedia using Python while the bailout data was available as a downloadable spreadsheet on Statista. I had initially attempted to scrape the data on Statista to concatenate the datasets in Python. However, I ultimately decided to make use of the spreadsheet since I found it excessively time-consuming to scrape tooltip-data which only appears when you hover the mouse over the bars. Using the spreadsheet, I divided the airline groups whose bailout data was separated into multiple airlines in the scraped dataset to obtain more matching observations.</descr>

            <h3>Number of passengers carried in Europe (1996-2020)</h3>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart2400"></div>
            <descr><br>This map chart shows the number of passengers carried by European country to show the growing demand of air transport to be split across competing carriers. The only challenge here was finding data sources which had data for as many European countries and for as many years as possible. Eurostat provides similar data, but define passenger count differently and completely or almost completely lack data for seven of the European countries depicted in the map. I therefore chose to stick with the dataset provided by the World Bank Data.</descr>
            <descr><br><br>The dataset was available on the World Bank Data website as a csv-file. Before beginning the cleaning process, I used Excel to separate the European countries from the non-European countries. I then moved the dataset to Python (Google Colab) to do the main data cleaning, such as removing redundant variables and transforming the data from long format to TIDY format.</descr>

            <h3>Clustering by Airline stock prices (2017-2022) [KLAR]</h3>
        <div class="frame">
            <pi><img src="project_clustering_stocks.png" alt="Cluster_pic" width="400" height="350"></pi>
        </div>
            
            <descr>Using unsupervised machine learning, the dendrogram displays clusters of stock prices between for Wizzair, Ryanair, TUI, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, EasyJet and AirFrance-KLM. I used Python to retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance to then cluster the data into groups. For this, I use loops before standardizing the data into comparable trends. At the end, I apply the Dynamic Time Warping technique, which accounts for temporal lags to better capture similarities in trends.</descr>

            <descr><br><br>The two low-cost carriers, Wizzair and Ryanair, are the most distinguishable set of airlines, as seen in the length of the upper purple branch. All the other carriers are grouped into the lower purple branch, where national flag carrier AirFrance-KLM and low-cost carrier EasyJet seemingly share more similarities in trends relative to the other airlines. The remaining clusters are somewhat inconsistent, as well.</descr>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <descr>In brief, it appears that LCCs are rising in popularity and have played a great role in maintaining connectivity in Europe during the pandemic between 2020 and 2021.
                The data further indicates that LCCs received significantly less publicly funded bailouts issued during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to its national flag or full-service carrier competitors, although LCCs generally serving a greater number of passengers. Despite the adverse consequences of the pandemic, coupled with governments' greater state aid packages for non-LCCs, LCCs appear to remain competitive.<br><br>Future researchers may want to scrape data on ticket fares from a range of airlines to compare price volatility over time across airline types and to perform clustering. </descr>
